### What's a Rails?

![I have no idea what I'm doing](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/4276638/7900410/b84a690a-070a-11e5-8f18-a97e1f04ee9d.jpg)

Never used Rails before? That's fine, perusing [this](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)
should help you get started. Never seen Ruby code before? No problem! Check out [TryRuby](http://tryruby.org/).

### Getting Started

Presumably, you've ditched the tie and are looking slightly more human in front
of your computer. Oh, you also probably know a thing or two about Ruby and
Rails. Congrats! You're now qualified to start contributing to the project!
Only a select few have made it this far.

Please refer to the
[contributing page in our wiki](https://github.com/hacsoc/hack_cwru/wiki/Contributing)
for some initial environment setup instructions, as well as for information
regarding our contributing workflow (it's fork and pull - look at me sparing
you experienced GitHub'ers a whole couple of minutes).

### Actually Doing Stuff

We're using Trello to track everything that we know we need to do. Contact
[adam@case.edu](mailto:adam@case.edu) to be added to the Trello (make sure
he adds you to the backend board, otherwise you'll probably be pretty
confused).

Bugs and new feature requests should be recording using
[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/hacsoc/hack_cwru/issues/new).

Happy hacking!

## Related Projects

What use would our beautiful backend be if we didn't have some fancy
smartphones to hook it up to? We've got repos for both
[iOS](https://github.com/hacsoc/hack_cwru-ios) and
[Android](https://github.com/hascosc/hack_cwru-android) which would love
your contributions if you're feeling up for it.
